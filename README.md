🔥 IoT-Enabled Fire-Extinguishing Rover

An autonomous IoT-based fire-extinguishing rover built using Raspberry Pi Pico W that detects fire through temperature sensing and extinguishes it automatically using a water pump system. The rover can be monitored and controlled remotely via a Wi-Fi-based web interface.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing safety using IoT and embedded systems. The rover continuously monitors temperature in its surroundings and reacts instantly when abnormal heat is detected, helping prevent fire hazards in industrial or domestic environments.

🤖 Fully Automated Fire-Extinguishing Mechanism

🧠 Working Principle

The temperature sensor continuously monitors environmental temperature.

When the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, the system detects a fire hazard.

The Raspberry Pi Pico W processes the sensor data using MicroPython.

A relay module is triggered to activate the water pump.

The rover moves toward the heat source and extinguishes the fire automatically.

Real-time status can be monitored via a Wi-Fi-based web interface.
